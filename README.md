# Learning Journey
These to track my journey of learning concepts of internet, linux and CTF with the help of some online resources. 

# Write-up Philosophy
I am strong believer of **"learning by doing"** philosophy. 

The format that I will be following in my writeup will a guidance focused rather than solution driven so, I will not have answer present in the writeup but rather will have some step-by-step method that I used to reach to solution.

# Resources
These are some online resources that are helping me thoughout my journey of getting use to CTFs. This list will improve as I move forward on my journey:
